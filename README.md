# Spelling and Grammar Checker Component with ReactJS + Ollama

This project is the start of the implementation of a spelling and grammar checker component using ReactJS and Ollama as the API. The project aims to mimic the web service functionality that Grammarly provides.

## Project Structure

This project is structured into different folders where each folder has a specific purpose:

- `src/component/`: This folder contains the `ControlledEditableDiv.tsx` which is a primary component for the grammar and spell check.
- `src/services/`: This folder contains `GrammarAndSpellingCheck.tsx`, a service file where the spell and grammar check logic is implemented using Ollama APIs.
- `src/view/`: This folder holds the `Project.tsx` file, a UI representation of the project.
- `src/`: This folder contains `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`, the entry point of the application and the main App component respectively.
